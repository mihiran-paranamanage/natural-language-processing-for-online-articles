Seylan Bank’s 2016 Annual Report - ‘It’s all about the Journey’ was recognised with the Bronze Award under the banking institutions category at CA Sri Lanka’s 53rd Annual Report Awards Ceremony recently. In addition, Seylan Developments PLC, a subsidiary of Seylan Bank also bagged Gold under the Land & Property category, for the sixth consecutive year. The event was graced by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, the theme of this year’s CA Sri Lanka Annual Report Awards was ‘Quintessence of Eminence’ which focused on recognising the most cohesive, clear and customised annual reports that best reflect an entity’s operation, whilst going beyond its financial performance. Over 140 organisations from small-time community groups to blue-chip companies and conglomerates participated in the competition.

Winners were selected on their ability to communicate the objectives, highlights, performance, personnel and management clearly to an intended audience. These awards provide a holistic view of an organization’s performance, going beyond the company’s bottom-line.

Commenting on the recognition Kapila Ariyaratne, Director/CEO Seylan Bank said, “We are happy to be recognised with Bronze for our 2016 Annual Report. The award is a testament which reflects our hard work, dedication and quality in reporting. CA Sri Lanka’s Annual Report Awards is widely known as the benchmark for assessing quality corporate reporting in Sri Lanka and this recognition is also a key morale enhancer for the entire Seylan team to achieve bigger milestones in the upcoming years as well.”
